# Royal Order of Adjectives

## Explanation
The "Royal Order of Adjectives" refers to the conventional order in which adjectives are arranged in English when multiple adjectives modify a single noun. This order is not strictly grammatical but is a stylistic preference to make phrases sound natural and euphonious. It follows a hierarchy based on semantic categories, progressing from more general to more specific attributes.

The standard order is often remembered by the mnemonic: **Q**uantity, **O**pinion, **S**ize, **A**ge, **S**hape, **C**olor, **P**roper adjective, **P**urpose/**M**aterial.

### Categories and Order
1. **Quantity/Number**: Determiners indicating amount (e.g., one, two, many, few).
2. **Opinion**: Subjective judgments (e.g., beautiful, ugly, good, bad).
3. **Size**: Physical dimensions (e.g., large, small, tall, short).
4. **Age**: Time-related (e.g., old, new, young, ancient).
5. **Shape**: Form or outline (e.g., round, square, rectangular).
6. **Color**: Hue (e.g., red, blue, green).
7. **Proper Adjective**: Derived from proper nouns (e.g., American, Victorian).
8. **Purpose/Material**: Intended use or composition (e.g., wooden, swimming, woolen).

### Examples
- Correct: "A beautiful large old round red American dining table."
- Incorrect: "A red round old large beautiful dining American table."

This order ensures clarity and flow in descriptions, especially useful for generating product descriptions in inventory systems like FrontAccounting.
