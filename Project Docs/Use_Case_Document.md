# Use Case Document - FA_ProductAttributes_Variations Plugin

## Overview
This document describes use cases for the FA_ProductAttributes_Variations plugin, which provides WooCommerce-style product variations functionality. The plugin enables parent-child product relationships where variations are automatically generated based on attribute combinations.

## Variations Plugin Responsibilities
- Parent product definition and variation generation
- Variation-specific stock and pricing management
- Bulk operations for variation management
- Retroactive pattern analysis for existing products
- Integration with FA's sales and inventory systems

## Use Case: Create Product Variations

### Actors
- Product Manager (Primary Actor)
- Inventory Manager (Supporting Actor)

### Preconditions
- FA_ProductAttributes_Core module is installed and active
- FA_ProductAttributes_Variations plugin is installed and active
- Product has attributes assigned (e.g., Size: Small/Medium/Large, Color: Red/Blue)

### Main Flow
1. Product Manager navigates to product editing interface
2. Selects "Create Variations" option for the product
3. System generates all possible attribute combinations (Small-Red, Small-Blue, Medium-Red, etc.)
4. Manager reviews and modifies generated variations as needed
5. Sets variation-specific pricing rules and stock levels
6. Saves variations and updates parent product status

### Alternative Flows
- **Manual Variation Creation**: Manager creates specific variations instead of auto-generating all combinations
- **Bulk Variation Operations**: Manager applies changes to multiple variations simultaneously

### Postconditions
- Parent product has associated variation products
- Each variation has unique SKU, pricing, and stock levels
- Variations are available for sales and inventory management
- Royal Order ensures consistent attribute display across the system.

### Alternative Flows
- Edit existing category: Update name, Royal Order, or values.
- Delete category: Confirm no products are using it, then remove.
- Bulk operations: Import/export attribute structures.

## Use Case: Assign Attributes to Products (Core Functionality)

### Actors
- Product Manager (Primary Actor)

### Preconditions

## Use Case: Add New Attribute to Existing Product Line and Generate Variations

### Actors
- Product Manager (Primary Actor)

### Preconditions
- Product Manager has access to FrontAccounting.
- Master product exists with existing variations (parent flag = true).
- New attribute category (e.g., Color) is defined or will be created.

### Main Flow
1. Product Manager navigates to the Items screen for the master product.
2. On the "Product Attributes" TAB, views existing associated categories (e.g., Size, Slogan).
3. Adds the new category (e.g., Color) and selects values (e.g., White, Blue).
4. Clicks "Create Variations" button, with option to check "Copy Sales Pricing".
5. System identifies existing variations and generates new combinations including the new attribute.
   - For example, if existing: T-Shirt-S-Quote1, T-Shirt-M-Quote1; new: T-Shirt-S-Quote1-White, T-Shirt-S-Quote1-Blue, etc.
   - Uses "Royal Order of adjectives" for attribute ordering (based on category Royal Order values).
   - Stock_id: Parent stock_id + attribute abbreviations in order (e.g., TSHIRT-S-QUOTE1-WHT).
   - Short description: Replace ${ATTRIB_CLASS} placeholders in parent description with long attribute names (e.g., if parent has "T-Shirt - ${Size} ${Quote} ${Color}", variation becomes "T-Shirt - Small Quote1 White").
   - If "Copy Sales Pricing" checked, copies prices from master or existing variations.
