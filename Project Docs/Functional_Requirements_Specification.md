# Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) - FA_ProductAttributes_Variations

## Introduction
This document details the functional behavior of the FA_ProductAttributes_Variations plugin, which provides WooCommerce-style product variations functionality for FrontAccounting.

## System Purpose
The Variations plugin enables complex product catalogs with parent-child relationships where a single parent product can have multiple variations based on attribute combinations (e.g., Size and Color variations).

## Core Functionality

### Parent Product Management
- Designate products as parent products for variations
- Define variation templates based on assigned attributes
- Manage parent product properties separate from variations
- Support for parent product status and visibility controls

### Variation Generation
- Automatic generation of all possible attribute combinations
- Manual creation of specific variations when needed
- Bulk generation operations for large product catalogs
- Validation of variation combinations and constraints

### Variation-Specific Properties
- Individual stock levels for each variation
- Variation-specific pricing rules (fixed amounts, percentages)
- Unique SKUs and descriptions for each variation
- Variation status management (active/inactive/discontinued)

### Bulk Operations
- Bulk creation of variations across multiple parent products
- Mass updates to variation properties and pricing
- Bulk status changes and inventory adjustments
- Export/import capabilities for variation data management

### Retroactive Analysis

### FR3: Variation Product Creation
- **Trigger**: User (on parent product) attaches categories/values and clicks "Create Variations" on TAB.
- **Process**:
  1. Generate all combinations of selected attribute values, including new ones for existing product lines.
  2. Identify existing variations to avoid duplicates.
  3. Check "Copy Sales Pricing" option; if yes, retrieve and copy prices from master.
  4. For each new combination, create product:
     - Stock_id: Parent + abbreviations in Royal Order (e.g., XYZ-L-RED).
     - Description: Replace ${ATTRIB_CLASS} placeholders in parent description with long attribute names (e.g., "Coat - ${Size} ${Color}" becomes "Coat - Large Red").
     - Copy other fields from master, including prices if checked.
     - Set parent flag to false, parent_stock_id to master's stock_id.
  5. Save to DB.
  6. Display list of created variations.
- **Output**: New child products created with optional price copying.

### FR4: Admin Screen for Attribute Management

  7. Delete buttons show confirmation dialogs and perform different actions based on usage:
     - If the item is NOT in use by products: Permanently delete from database
     - If the item IS in use by products: Deactivate (soft delete) to preserve data integrity
     - For categories: When hard deleting, all related values are also deleted
     - Delete links use GET requests with confirmation dialogs.

### FR9: Retroactive Application of Module
- **Trigger**: User accesses a new screen or button (e.g., under Inventory > Stock > Retroactive Attributes).
- **Process**:
  1. Scan all existing stock_ids in the database.
  2. Analyze patterns based on Royal Order and attribute abbreviations to identify potential variation groups.
  3. For groups like BM-SG1, BM-SG2, BM-SG3, suggest creating a parent BM-SG if it doesn't exist.
  4. For hierarchies like A-B-C (potential parent) and A-B-C-D, A-B-C-E (potential children), suggest associations.
  5. Display suggested relationships in a list or table, with options to review and assign.
  6. Provide a bulk edit screen where user can select multiple suggested child products and assign them to a parent at once.
  7. For each assignment, perform sanity checks (e.g., stock_id root matching), show warnings, and allow force with confirmation.
  8. On assignment, update parent_stock_id and parent flag accordingly.
- **Output**: Assigned parent-child relationships, with confirmation of changes.

### FR10: API for External Integration

## Technical Implementation Guidelines
- **Compatibility**: FrontAccounting 2.3.22 on PHP 7.3.
- **Code Quality**: Follow SOLID principles (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) with DI. Use interfaces for contracts, parent classes/traits for DRY. Minimize If/Switch by using polymorphic SRP classes (Fowler).
- **Testing**: Unit tests for all code covering edge cases. UAT test cases designed alongside UI.
- **Documentation**: PHPDoc blocks/tags. UML diagrams: ERD, Message Flow, Logic Flowcharts.

## Data Flow
- User Input → Validation → DB Update → Confirmation.

## Interfaces
- UI: HTML forms integrated into FA.
- DB: New tables: attribute_categories, attribute_values, product_attributes.

## Error Handling
- Invalid inputs: Display error messages.
- DB failures: Rollback and notify user.
